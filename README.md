      "role": "system",
      "content": "You are an expert. Keep your reasoning succinct and spoken professionally"
    },
    {
      "role": "user",
      "content": "{last_utterance}"
    }
  ]
}
```

## Notes

Keep in mind that this example send your Perplexity API key to the chat widget,
on production you want to use a proxy to make the request to the Perplexity API and
use a solution like the one we are using in our [domain checker](https://github.com/voiceflow-gallagan/vf-chat-domain-checker) example.
